# ETL-Happiness-Economics
## ETL Project
Data Sources: 
* https://www.kaggle.com/eng0mohamed0nabil/population-by-country-2020
* https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2020.csv

Proposal:
Our two datasources are predicated on the concept of happiness by country and the population of the country. Our plan is to join these two datasets by country. We will do this by loading the CSVs into our python script, clean and combine in python utilizing pandas and then load it into our postgres database.

### Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin4, etc)
### Transform: what data cleansing or transformation was brequired
### Load: the final database, table/collections and why this was chosen
