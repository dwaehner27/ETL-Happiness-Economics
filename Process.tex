First, using python, we imported our two files, the happiness dataset and the population dataset.  We then trimmed down each dataset so that the final, combined dataset would be more focused.  We wanted to focus. more in economic indicators so the happiness dataset was cut to include country name, country region, happiness score, GDP per capita, social support score, and corruption percentage.  The population dataset was cut to include country, population, population density, land area, and migrants.

Next, we defined our tables in sql and also defined the joined table.  After that, we connected to our sql session using sqlalchemy, read our datasets into their tables, and created the final combined dataset.
